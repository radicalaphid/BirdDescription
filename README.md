# BirdDescription
Find out what bird it is.

This class describes several different birds 
that include songbirds, eagles, and owls. The class
runs through a number of functions that calculated
on the appearance described, selects the choice of
whichever category.

The class is BirdDescription which creates several variables to use.
Size is the first variable, which finds out how big the bird is.
Color finds the main color of the bird.
Appearance is the final variable, which uses any of the unique traits of the bird.

There are a few methods:
get_species retrieves the species. It then returns it for the user to see.
set_species asks for user input on the species and then sets the input to a variable.
set_speciesOWL is when the input is defined as "owl" or "Owl" 
and puts the user through a quiz format to see what kind of owl it is through a series
of questions.
set_speciesEAGLE is when the input is defined as "eagle" or "Eagle" 
and puts the user through a quiz format to see what kind of eagle it is through a series
of questions.
set_speciesSONGBIRD is when the input is defined as "songbird" or "Songbird" 
and puts the user through a quiz format to see what kind of songbird it is through a series
of questions.
The demo program initates the user through a story, in which the user is prompted for their name.
The reason for the story is explained, and then an event happened in which the user must
describe the bird that flew overhead to the program.
The demo program will automatically run through the main function, in which it will prompt
the user for their username and other inputs. All the user needs to do is type inputs.
